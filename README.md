# mortgage-sim-city

I would like to build a martketing site for for young people looking to get a mortgage in stockholm. The name should SkippatopplÃ¥n.

The app should explain the value prop of the service. 

The app should have a simulator allowing users to: 
- Insert monthly salary
- Insert target price of property
Output should be: 
- Interest rate in %
